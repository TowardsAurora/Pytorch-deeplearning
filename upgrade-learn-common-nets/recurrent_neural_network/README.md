## RNN
### EASYRNN
simply using pytorch to implement a simple RNN model
using nn.RNN model to build a simple RNN model

to slove the tensor's shape problem on MNIST dataset we need to reshape the input data and using x[:, -1, :] to decrease the second dimension of the tensor

### RNN_LSTM
using nn.LSTM model to build a simple LSTM model
